Mainly, the puddin boyz make rice pudding. Here is their most recent [recipe](http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1014636-rice-pudding-with-golden-raisins), courtesy of melissa clark.

### Ingredients

* 3 ½ cups whole milk
* ¼ cup heavy cream
* ⅓ cup light brown sugar
* ½ cup long-grain white rice
* ¼ teaspoon salt
* 1 vanilla bean, split
* 1 cinnamon stick AND 4 cardamom pods
* 1 strip orange peel, 1-inch wide
* ⅓ cup golden raisins (optional, jesse hates these.)

### Preparation

In a medium heavy-bottom pot, combine milk, cream, sugar, rice and salt.

Scrape in seeds from vanilla bean and drop them in along with the pod. Stir in cinnamon and orange peel.

Bring mixture to a simmer; cook over medium-low heat, stirring frequently until rice is tender and mixture is slightly thickened, 30 to 40 minutes. Do not let mixture come to a boil and don’t let it get too thick, because it will thicken as it cools.

(Stir in raisins and let pudding rest for 5 minutes to soften them.)
